This repository is for Data Science Specialisation - Getting and Cleaning Data's week 4 course project

4 Files included: README.md, codebook.md, run_analysis.R, tidy_data.txt

Followings are done:

1 download data:activity_labels.txt, features.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt

2 read data Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

3 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

4 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

5-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

6-From the data set in step 4, creates a second,independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
